# Heart-Attack-Prediction
It is a Graphical User Interface System which is based on tkinter library

**What is Logistic Regression ?**

Logistic Regression is a statistical and machine-learning techniques classifying records of a dataset based on the values of the input fields . It predicts a dependent variable based on one or more set of independent variables to predict outcomes . It can be used both for binary classification and multi-class classification.

**##Objective**
The primary objective of this study was to classify heart disease using logistic regression model and a real-world dataset. 
The logistic regression algorithm was applied to a dataset of patients with heart disease to predict the presence of the disease.
